    <h2>Genesis at Lunch</h2>
    <p>I still remember sitting across from my former employer at a lunch, sketching out a wiki-style CRM extension to help our rookie sales team. As I drafted the project brief that evening, a single thought struck me: what if AI could automate every step? From that spark grew <strong>Project Chimera</strong>(actual name redacted cause NDA), a self-teaching network of AI agents wired together in a closed-loop feedback system.</p>

    <h2>Sales Automation Pipeline</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lead Sourcing & Qualification:</strong> Pull raw leads from any lead source API, score prospects by company size, annual revenue, and industry, and push only the qualified leads into our CRM.</li>
      <li><strong>Automated Outreach & Tracking:</strong> Send personalized marketing emails with embedded tracking codes. When a recipient clicks, trigger an AI calling agent trained on our product catalog and sales playbook.</li>
      <li><strong>AI-to-Human Handoff:</strong> The agent follows a decision tree—if the prospect opts into our subscription, it handles payment; otherwise, it schedules a live meeting. Handoffs create tasks in the CRM for sales reps in real time.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscription Model & Onboarding:</strong> We replaced a 60–90 day, $12–$15K project with a 21-day delivery guarantee and $299/month subscription. Upon payment, a webhook provisions a client portal and prompts the client to complete a design/info form.</li>
      <li><strong>Client-Voice Model Fine-Tuning:</strong> Scrape specified segments of the client’s existing website to gather tone and content style, then fine-tune a custom model weekly on scraped content, engagement metrics, SEO audits, keyword research, and competitor analyses.</li>
      <li><strong>Real-Time Sales Coaching:</strong> During meetings, reps see live sentiment analysis and receive contextual talking points. After each call, a “sales master” AI delivers personalized coaching tips and performance metrics.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Digital Marketing Automation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Client-Specific Content Models:</strong> Every blog post, social update, and ad copy piece is generated by the client’s fine-tuned model, consuming weekly data: engagement stats, SEO audit results, keyword research, and competitor insights.</li>
      <li><strong>Adaptive Content Strategy:</strong> Models re-plan content calendars weekly—adjusting topics, formats, hashtags, and optimal post times based on the latest metrics.</li>
      <li><strong>Human Review & Publishing:</strong> Drafts are queued for swift human approval. Once approved, content is automatically scheduled and published via connected social and ad channels.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Automated Website Creation & Deployment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Onboarding Form & Data Capture:</strong> Clients complete their portal’s design/info form, including their current website URL and branding guidelines.</li>
      <li><strong>AI-Driven Site Generation:</strong> A specialized, fine-tuned model ingests form responses and scraped site content as prompts, producing a complete website design and content structure.</li>
      <li><strong>WordPress Deployment:</strong> A third-party automation tool takes the AI-generated blueprint and creates a live WordPress site—configuring themes, populating pages, and installing plugins. Within minutes, clients have a new site reflecting their brand voice and SEO strategy.</li>
    </ul>

      <p>Project Chimera’s closed-loop architecture—where sales, marketing, and website creation modules learn from each other—drives exponential improvement over time. By orchestrating best-in-class AI services into one self-teaching system, I proved that one person can replace an entire digital marketing agency—and that this modular blueprint can scale to any industry or business function.</p>
